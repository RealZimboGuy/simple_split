# Simple Split Mobile

A mobile application for splitting expenses with friends and groups.

## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and update the `API_BASE_URL` with your API endpoint:
   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.com/api
   ```

3. The `.env` file is excluded from version control for security reasons. Always keep your API endpoint confidential.
